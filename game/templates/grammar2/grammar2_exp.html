      <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">P: Hello, people. Welcome to Hippo and Parakeet: Pull and Rush. My name is Parataxis Kent Halliday II, but folks call me Parakeet. I love driving my taxi, and having some illegal races, or the so-called ‚Äúpiques‚Äùüòº, with my friends from time to time. </mark></p>
      <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">H: Hi, guys, I'm Hippopotaximus Amphibius, but it is too long. So just call me Hippo üôÅ. I enjoy driving too, but I have to confess I'm not a really good driver, my taxi always turns off halfway through or doesn't even turn on properly. </p>

      <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">P: Why are you here? Oh!, let me guess, having troubles getting Hypotaxis and Parataxis? He,he‚Ä¶ Well, lucky you, my Hippo friend and I are here to give you a hand. </mark></p>
      <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">H: Yup, yup, we¬¥re gonna use our taxis. So, fasten your seatbelts and let's get started! </p>

      <p class="lead mb-4 text-warning">God: Here you have a taxi. Now, imagine this taxi is a simple clause. So it can stand on its own.  </mark></p>
      <p class="lead mb-4 text-warning">God: However, when there are two taxis, or simple clauses, they turn into a complex clause.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">P: Didn‚Äôt I tell you that illegal races please me? He‚Ä¶he. It 's funny since those races also remind me of my Grammar classes. Let me tell you why. </mark></p>
        <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">In the ‚Äúpiques‚Äù, I see two taxis racing side by side as two independent clauses in a complex clause. For you to know, this relationship is called Parataxis.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">In technical terms, this clause relationship is known as Parataxis, where each one of them have full meaning by their own</p>
        <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">I see each taxi as an independent clause, because the taxis can go by their own. </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">Example: Parakeet likes to compete in illegal races and he is a very good taxi driver.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">H: But don't forget about me!</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">I've been stuck in my way. So sometimes I need help from my bud Parakeet</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">Parakeet has helped me by pulling my car out of the race to be fixed. It's like hypotaxis, isn't it?</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">The hypotaxis is when a clause drag another clause, so the dependant clause depends on the other one</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">Example: Parakeet runs the race while he pulls Hippo¬¥s taxi. </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">H: Sometimes I think Parakeet is going crazy because, even in the middle of one of those illegal races, he's willing to pull my taxi along the run.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">I usually relate this situation when there is hypotaxis within parataxis, there are 3 clauses: 2 independant and 1 dependant</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-primary">Example: Parakeet likes to compete in illegal races while he pulls Hippo‚Äôs car but he still wins the races.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">P: Crazy?  I'm not crazy, I'm fearless!!</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">I mean, who else can pull two or more cars and still win the race??</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">One clause can carry more than one clause. It's like parataxis within hypotaxis</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4 text-success">Example: Parakeet runs the race while he pulls Hippo¬¥s taxi and steps on the gas. </p>
