                  <p class="lead fs-3 mb-4">In the ‚Äúpiques‚Äù, we can see two taxis racing side by side. Neither depends on the other to successfully compete. Both taxis are at the same level as both are independent.</p>

                  <p class="lead fs-3 mb-4">To be in parataxis means that two clauses united by a conjunction can stand on their on. You can eliminate any of them and they will keep a complete meaning.</p>
                  <p class="lead fs-3 mb-4">The conjunctions found in this kind of relationship are the FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet and so. </p>
